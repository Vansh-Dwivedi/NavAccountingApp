## Installation Instructions

To set up and run this Application made in MERN Stack, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Vansh-Dwivedi/NavAccountingApp.git
   cd NavAccountingApp
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```
   npm install
   cd client && npm install
   cd ../server && npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add necessary variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret)
   - Create a `.env.development.local` file in the `client` directory and add `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://localhost:8443`

4. Start the development servers:
   - For the client: `npm run client:start`
   - For the server: `npm run server:start`

5. Access the application at `https://localhost:8443` in your web browser

## Additional Instructions

- Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or provide a valid MongoDB URI in the server's `.env` file.
